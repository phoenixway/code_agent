# Semantic Runtime Migration Roadmap

This document outlines the phased plan to migrate the runtime from legacy response parsing to a robust semantic access layer over the compiler's Intermediate Representation (IR).

**Goal**: Systematically replace legacy semantic extraction with a new `RuntimeProtocolSemantics` adapter, making the runtime more robust, efficient, and maintainable.

---

### Phase 0: Boundary Freeze (Done)

- **Goal**: Stabilize the existing compiler/runtime boundary before major changes.
- **Allowed**: Consolidate compiler metadata reads in `output_recovery` into a single helper. Add diagnostic logging.
- **Forbidden**: No behavior changes. No new compiler authority.
- **Done When**: `output_recovery` uses a single, tested helper for `error_code`, `recovery_id`, and `invalid_kind` with fallbacks.

---

### Governance Phase 1: Governance Alignment (Done)

- **Goal**: Align all governance documents with the actual completed work and established boundaries.
- **Allowed**: Create and align documentation in `docs/architecture/`.
- **Forbidden**: No production code changes.
- **Done When**: Constitution, roadmap, authority boundaries, stop lines, and test contracts are aligned and approved.

---

### Phase 2: Consumer Inventory (Done)

- **Goal**: Create a detailed inventory of all locations that consume response semantics.
- **Allowed**: Audit the codebase and create a comprehensive inventory document.
- **Forbidden**: No refactoring of consumer logic. No production code changes.
- **Done When**: The `Consumer Inventory` table in `protocol-authority-boundaries.md` is complete and approved.

---

### Phase 3: Accessor Module (Active: API Design)

- **Goal**: Design and document the API for the new semantic accessor functions in a dedicated module.
- **Allowed**: Create API documentation and design for a new module (e.g., `modules/agent/orchestration/responses/semantic_accessors.py`). The canonical design lives in `docs/architecture/semantic-accessor-api-design.md`.
- **Forbidden**: No implementation of the module or its functions. Migrating any existing consumer to use the new accessors.
- **Done When**: The API design in `semantic-accessor-api-design.md` is complete, reviewed, and approved. Implementation will be a separate phase.

---
**NOTE on Phase 3 Progress**: A sub-part of this migration, **Phase 3A**, was completed to support `output_recovery` improvements. This work is documented in `current-refactor-state.md` and `response_protocol.md`. It focused on migrating compiler metadata reads (`error_code`, `recovery_id`, `invalid_kind`) and is considered **Done**. The main "Accessor Module" work is now considered **Phase 3B** and has not yet started.

---

### Phase 4: Behavior-Preserving Wrapper Migration

- **Goal**: Begin migrating consumers to the new accessors in a behavior-preserving way.
- **Allowed**: Replace direct field reads (`parsed_output.invalid_kind`) or simple `ResponseSemantics` calls with the equivalent new accessor.
- **Forbidden**: Changing any logic. This is a pure "find and replace" with the new function call.
- **Done When**: All simple, 1-to-1 replacements are complete.

---

### Phase 5: TransitionSemanticValidator

- **Goal**: Refactor `IntentTransitionHandler` to use a dedicated semantic validator.
- **Allowed**: Create a `TransitionSemanticValidator` class that uses the new accessors to check for valid transitions. Refactor `IntentTransitionHandler` to delegate to this validator.
- **Forbidden**: Changing transition logic itself.
- **Done When**: `IntentTransitionHandler` no longer performs its own response parsing.

---

### Phase 6: Bundle Semantic Validation Pass

- **Goal**: Centralize atomic bundle validation using semantic accessors.
- **Allowed**: Refactor `_reject_invalid_atomic_bundle_before_transition` to use a new validation pass composed of semantic accessor calls.
- **Forbidden**: Changing the logic of what constitutes a valid bundle.
- **Done When**: Bundle pre-validation is free of direct `ParsedModelOutput` reads.

---

### Phase 7: Plan-First Bundle Execution

- **Goal**: Refactor `DispatchPipeline` to execute from a plan derived from semantic accessors, not from reparsed segments.
- **Allowed**: Modify `ResponsePipeline` to build an `ExecutionPlan` using semantic accessors. Modify `DispatchPipeline` to execute this plan.
- **Forbidden**: Changing dispatch side effects.
- **Done When**: `DispatchPipeline` no longer receives raw segments.

---

### Phase 8: RecoveryStrategy Registry Expansion

- **Goal**: Expand the `CompilerRecoveryRegistry` to cover more structural errors.
- **Allowed**: Add new strategies for errors currently handled by legacy `invalid_kind` routing.
- **Forbidden**: Adding strategies for runtime-owned policy decisions.
- **Done When**: All purely structural `invalid_kind`s are routed through the compiler registry.

---

### Phase 9: Observability/Replay

- **Goal**: Improve debugging by enabling replay of semantic decisions.
- **Allowed**: Log the inputs and outputs of semantic accessors. Create a debug tool to replay a response through the semantic layer.
- **Forbidden**: Adding complexity to the production path.
- **Done When**: A given production response can be re-evaluated offline.

---

### Phase 10: Legacy Cleanup

- **Goal**: Remove deprecated legacy fields and helpers.
- **Allowed**: Remove `ResponseSemantics`, `has_action_segment`, and other legacy fields from `ParsedModelOutput`.
- **Forbidden**: Removing anything that still has a consumer.
- **Done When**: `ResponseSemantics` is deleted.
